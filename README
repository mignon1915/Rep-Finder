URIs for all "people" (composers and poets) and works (songs, cycles, text sources) will be identified by Library of Congress Subject Heading (LCSH).

LCSH subject heading conversion to URI:
		all punctuation and spaces will be removed 
		all diacritics will be normalized (e-umlaut=eu)
	examples:
		"Joyce, James, 1882-1941" becomes /JoyceJames18821941
		"Barber, Samuel, 1910-1981. Nuvoletta" becomes /BarberSamuel19101981Nuvoletta
		"Brahms, Johannes, 1833-1897. Gesänge, viola, piano acc., op. 91" becomes /BrahmsJohannes18831897Gesaengeviolapianoaccomp91
